# scala-jvm-sbox-playground
Code to experiment with the JVM sandbox security in Scala.

The Sandboxes folder contains a Sandbox implemented in Scala I used to understand the JVM sandbox model and prepare a presentation for OWASP Dublin. It is not meant to be secure and the code is visibly hacked together.
The Plugins folder contains several plugins to exploit different weaknesses exposed in the Sandbox via code or the Java security policy.
